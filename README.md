## Ray Tracer implemented in Rust

Using Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) as a reference. This is my first foray into learning and coding with Rust so there is almost a guarantee that much of it is not idiomatic or what is optimal for how it might be implemented in Rust.

## Current Output/Progress
![corrected sphere with with soft shadows](https://github.com/cshangjie/rust-ray-tracer/blob/main/data/gamma%20corrected%20diffuse%20material.png)
![two gamma corrected spheres with with soft shadows](https://github.com/cshangjie/rust-ray-tracer/blob/main/data/two_spheres.png?raw=true)

## To-Do
* Implement different materials
