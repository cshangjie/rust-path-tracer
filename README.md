## Ray Tracer implemented in Rust

Using Peter Shirley's [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) as well as Jamis Buck's [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/) as references. This is my first foray into learning and coding with Rust so there is almost a guarantee that much of it is not idiomatic or what is optimal for how it might be implemented in Rust.
